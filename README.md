# Structural Diagnostics Ontology (SODIA)

The **Structural Diagnostics Ontology (SODIA)** is a structured knowledge representation designed to formalize concepts and processes related to **Non-Destructive Inspection (NDI) methods** for bridge structures. It provides a **semantic framework** that enhances the **understanding, integration, and digital representation** of NDI techniques, supporting **knowledge management and decision-making** in bridge inspection and maintenance.

## 📌 Purpose
The primary objective of Sodia is to establish a standardized ontology that:
- **Facilitates a unified representation** of NDI methods in bridge assessment  
- **Enhances data interoperability** and integration across systems  
- **Supports decision-making** in infrastructure maintenance  
- **Promotes knowledge sharing** within the engineering and research community
